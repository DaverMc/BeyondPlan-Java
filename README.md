# BeyondPlan

Beyond Plan will be a software Tool to build your own Planning Systems.
Like for example a CMMS for maintenance or for project managment. 
It will consist of a core server which will comunicate with a database and utilizes a Web-API.
To this Web-API a Desktop-Application, a Website and a Mobile App will connect.
Each of these systems will be desined to run in two states. One a Builder state where you can configure everything.
And the productive visualisation. Every piece of the puzzle will have a module manager. This allows further expandability.
For that their will be a java, javascript and react Client-API. Surely you can create your own things and connect it to the Web-API.

It is a big project an will take a lot of time but i'm looking forward to create a revolutionizing piece of software for planning.

I'm planning to offer these base components for free use. 
I will only offer a support to configure the system to your liking.
If you are programming your own extensions then we will discuss if you can sell it. But for further information view the LICENSE.md.
